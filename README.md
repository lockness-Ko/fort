This one's the lighthouse score through a slow vpn connection in a different country connecting to an instance on a residential ip!

## Installation

To install, all you need is docker and docker-compose and common sense (please don't use the default credentials).

You should edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the storage location for persistent storage (`STORAGE_PATH`).

The default login is `admin:admin`. You can change this and add new users by running the `add-user` script:

```bash
# Change admin password
docker-compose exec -it www /app/add-user "admin" "password"

# Add a new user
docker-compose exec -it www /app/add-user "username" "password"
```

You'll also need to edit the `LAT` and `LON` environment variables if you want accurate weather info.

To run the service, type the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

and visit the webpage in your browser.

## Authentication/Authorizing

Since I will probably forget how I've implemented authentication in the future, here's how I did it:

- User clicks login
- Server checks password against bcrypt hash in private db (the key is the user)
- If the user has the right password continue, otherwise return 401
- Create a JWT that stores the user as the payload
- JWT is signed by the server
- User can use this jwt cookie as authorization to prove they are a specific user

### Mitigations agaisnt JWT bruteforcing

When the server starts up for the first time, it generates a random string of 2048 chars out of a choice of 88 chars. This is an arbitrary number that I think is **strong enough** against bruteforcing. Feel free to disagree with a pr.
