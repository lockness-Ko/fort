## Installation

To install, all you need is docker and docker-compose and common sense (please don't use the default credentials).

You WILL need to edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the default credentials (`ADMIN_LOGIN`). You may also want to change the storage location for persistent storage (`STORAGE_PATH`).

You'll also need to edit the `LAT` and `LON` environment variables if you want accurate weather info.

To run the service, type the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

and visit the webpage in your browser.
