This one's the lighthouse score through a slow vpn connection in a different country connecting to an instance on a residential ip!

## Installation

To install, all you need is docker and docker-compose and common sense (please don't use the default credentials).

You WILL need to edit `docker-compose.yml` and change the default credentials (`ADMIN_LOGIN`). You may also want to change the storage location for persistent storage (`STORAGE_PATH`).

You'll also need to edit the `LAT` and `LON` environment variables if you want accurate weather info.

To run the service, type the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

and visit the webpage in your browser.

## Authentication/Authorizing

Since I will probably forget how I've implemented authentication in the future, here's how I did it:

- User clicks login
- Server checks password against bcrypt hash in private db (the key is the user)
- If the user has the right password continue, otherwise return 401
- Create a JWT that stores the user as the payload
- JWT is signed by the server
- User can use this jwt cookie as authorization to prove they are a specific user

### Mitigations agaisnt JWT bruteforcing

When the server starts up for the first time, it generates a random string of 2048 chars out of a choice of 88 chars. This is an arbitrary number that I think is **strong enough** against bruteforcing. Feel free to disagree with a pr.
